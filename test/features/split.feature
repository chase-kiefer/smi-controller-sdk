  As a developer
  I need to ensure the specification is accepted by the server

 # Scenario: Apply alphav4 TrafficSplitter
 #   Given the server is running
 #   When I create an "alphav4" TrafficSplitter
 #   Then I expect the controller to have created 1 TrafficSplitter

 # Scenario: Apply alphav3 TrafficSplitter
 #   Given the server is running
 #   When I create an "alphav3" TrafficSplitter
 #   Then I expect the controller to have created 1 TrafficSplitter
 # 
 # Scenario: Apply alphav2 TrafficSplitter
 #   Given the server is running
 #   When I create an "alphav2" TrafficSplitter
 #   Then I expect the controller to have created 1 TrafficSplitter
 # 
 # Scenario: Apply alphav1 TrafficSplitter
